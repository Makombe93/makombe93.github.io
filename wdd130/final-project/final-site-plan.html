        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p> Someone somewhere right now is stressed up because they just do not have enough to afford what they need at that particular time to combat the prblem at hand. The purpose of this is to ensure that ideas are provided for any who might be in such
            a circumstance to create something that they can make on their own with affordable resources to meet their need.</p>
        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>The website will target mainly the mothers. They are the ones that are mostly faced with situations when they had to fix problems like a hole in a sock just when a child is about to leave for school or its a child's birthday and there is not enough
            ingredients to bake a cake how can she use that which is there to bring out an equally enriching cake. And for the youth, how to be creative on a budget, revamping old clothes will help them live within their means without feeling left behind,
            an idea on how to do that would definitely make all the difference.</p>
