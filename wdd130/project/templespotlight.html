                            <p class="paragraph">Rising above a stand of enchanting Jacaranda trees on Parktown Ridge, the six white-tipped spires of the Johannesburg South Africa Temple capture the attention of travelers on the M1 highway north of Johannesburg's city center.
                                Located on Jubilee Road, the temple shares its grounds with area offices including family history, employment, and distribution services. Visitors are welcome to learn more about the temple at the public visitors' center.The
                                Johannesburg South Africa Temple was the first temple built in Africa (and in South Africa). The first convert in South Africa, Henry Stringer, was baptized on June 15, 1853. However, the exodus of the Saints to Utah and
                                government-imposed restrictions on the number of missionaries who could serve greatly hindered the work in South Africa until the 1980s. The announcement of the Johannesburg South Africa Temple came less than three years
                                after the June 1978 revelation, announced by President Spencer W. Kimball, extending the priesthood and temple blessings to all worthy men regardless of race or color. The Johannesburg South Africa Temple is located in
                                the historic suburb of Parktown, known for its grand turn-of-the-century Victorian mansions, many of which have succumbed to commercial, educational, and civic developments. The nearly two-week public open house of the
                                Johannesburg South Africa Temple attracted more than 19,000 visitors including civic and business leaders and government representatives. Nearly 3,500 of the 12,000 members of the extensive temple district attended the
                                dedicatory services of the Johannesburg South Africa Temple. The dedication of the Johannesburg South Africa Temple brought a temple of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to every habitable continent of the
                                world.
